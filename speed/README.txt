The illuminalike reads generated by ART were downsampled to 1 and 5 million reads using the
"downsample_fq.sh" script. As there was not 5 M 480 bp reads to use, more were generated
with the "art.sh" script.

The fastq (fq) files were decompressed and processed using the "aln.sh" to measure the 
speed. Output data was sent to /dev/null

The speed results files (ie. bwa-mem.benchmark.txt) include the time to run the 8 fq files
(alphabetical order) three times. Col1=time(s), col2=RAM usage(kB), col3=CPU utilisation

To calculate throughput, I plotted the time taken for 1M and 5M reads and determined the
gradient. Median values were used for 1M and 5M file processing time.
